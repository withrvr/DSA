## üìí: NOTE

- All most 80% of file contain **__Solution Class__** only
- for problem statement because of
  - GFG practice problems
  - Leetcode problem
- So main function and print statement .. have to write exclusively ... to see the result
- but i have tried to add print statement in many files ... but no main fun

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: EXECUTION of code

1. Open terminal to that file location
2. Compile / Run the File
   - CPP:- `g++ ./[file-name].cpp && ./a.exe`
   - JAVA:- `java [file-name].java`

# üëÄ: EXAMPLE to execute

- CPP
  1. `cd ./Problem/Array/1/`
  2. `g++ ./a.cpp && ./a.exe`

- JAVA
  1. `cd ./Problem/Array/5/`
  2. `java c.java`

## Blue Print
- All Problems
  - on which Topics (ie. sub-catagories)
    - then no of problems assigned (ex. 10 for matrix)
      - then a.java, b.py, c.cpp, ..... (solution for then / through multiple approach ie. a, b, c) in diff lang if needed
      - readme.md ... links / contain all that i learned n details of individual file
