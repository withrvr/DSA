- Rearrange Array Alternately
- https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/-rearrange-array-alternately-1587115620/1

-

- [a.cpp](./a.cpp)
  - its only printing
  - not changing original `arr`
  - **don't work** as arr remains same after function is completed then also

- [b.cpp](./b.cpp)
  - solve with extra space ( but not expected)
  - then **copy paste** to arr

- c.cpp (TODO)
  - swap in same arr
  - without using extra variable or only printing
