# ðŸ“„: (4-Array) --> Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo

- [a.java](./a.java)
  - counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's.
  - Overwrite array with the total number
  - of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.

- [b.java](./b.java)
  - swaping
  - while tracking the last positions of the 0, 2
  - and traversing using mid ... and sorting

- [c.java](./c.java)
  - see which number is it
  - then add one more to where it belongs // like insertion sort
  - and at one one element to other numbers also .. who are after it

      1. Using sort method
      2. Counting no of zero .. then replace same array starting with 0's ... then other remaining with 1's
      3. left right flag
         - [o1.java](./o1.java)
         - tracking
         - swap / make it 0 and 1

- In my [LEETCODE Repo](https://github.com/withrvr/Leetcode) problem similar like this ... [@withrvr/leetcode](https://github.com/withrvr/Leetcode)
  - 75. Sort Colors
    - was fully same as main question
    - only 0,1,2 where are rwb (red,white,blue)
